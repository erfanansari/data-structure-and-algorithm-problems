### How to Solve

1. Understand the Problem
2. Explore Concrete Examples
3. Break it Down (pseudo code, comment the steps)
4. Solve/Simplify
5. Look Back and Refactor

#### 2 Essential parts of a recursive function

1. Base Case
2. Different Input

#### Time Complexity of different statements

simple operations => O(1) loops => O(n) recursion => O(log n) nested loops =>
O(n^2)

bubbleSort, selectionSort and insertions sort are often called quadratic sorting
algorithms because the time complexity of all of them is O(n^2) Although they
can actually perform better on very small datasets These algorithms don't scale
well to large datasets

# Data structures

Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the
functions or operations that can be applied to the data Different data
structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others
(like arrays) are more generally used.
